<h2> <img class="left" src="img/snake_icon.png" alt="medical"> Comparing The Two Articles:</h2>

<p>Both of these articles, while fighting for the same issue, take a totally different approach 
on how to address the reader of the matter at hand. Within article one, the author sticks to a 
more sophisticated tone as they use factual evidence to back their reasoning and explanations 
behind teacher salary struggles. Whereas, in article two the author writes with passion and desire 
as they explain to the reader struggles with teacher salaries; instead of providing evidence to 
back their reasoning they use strong, harsh diction to criticize the system and pay which teachers 
must work with. Both articles make strong arguments about teacher salaries but article two can be 
considered skewed due to it favoring one side of the argument and lack evidence while article one 
can be looked upon as stronger due to the overwhelming use of evidence and openness to both sides 
of the argument.</p>

<br/> <br/>

<h2> <img class="left" src="img/snake_icon.png" alt="medical"> Which is the better article?</h2>

<p>Out of the two articles given the first article seems to be the most informative article. 
Article one, while still having bias, backed their ideas on factual points/evidence unlike the 
second article which seemed to base the majority of its writing on personal opinion. I do feel 
it is more trustworthy because of the significant amount of evidence that is provided along with 
provided quotations from educated people. For example, in article one the author states, “Nearly 60% 
of people in a Ipsos/USA Today survey released Sept. 12 think teachers are underpaid, while a majority 
of both Republicans and Democrats believe they have the right to strike” (paragraph eleven). Another 
example where the author of article one provides adequate evidence is when they state, “Nationwide, the 
estimated average public-school teacher’s salary is now $58,950, according to the National Center for Education 
Statistics…” (paragraph sixteen). Both sentences within the article show the author's use of evidence to support 
their backing on teacher salaries; it is this type of evidence that allows me to put trust in this article. 
This however does not make the other article, article two, incorrect it just makes it a less credible source, 
but not wrong.</p>

<h2> <img class="left" src="img/snake_icon.png" alt="medical"> Taking Precautions</h2>

<p>While researching and reading about the issue of equal health care access, I need to be aware/cautious 
of underlying bias in the articles that I am receiving information from. I also need to be aware/cautious 
that the information I am receiving may not be from a  credible source and therefore might be incorrect or 
skewed. Another caution I need to take while learning about my issue is that I do not incorporate my own bias 
into the information I am putting out. By keeping myself from including my own bias, informing myself of the 
possibilities that articles can include underlying bias, and remembering that articles can give out incorrect/skewed 
information I can avoid transferring and including that bias within my own work and therefore put forward work that 
focuses on the issue at hand along with the statistics/facts that surround it. My work can then be considered a 
credible source - with as minimum bias as possible.</p>
