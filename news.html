<h3>Article Within the Green: Bloomberg - <i>What Made U.S. Health Care So Vulnerable to Covid-19</i></h3>

<p>Due to the current pandemic, the American healthcare system, the most expensive healthcare system in the world, 
has been under attack for its inability to handle the pandemic situation appropriately. Within the first six months of 
the pandemic, America had the greatest number of confirmed cases. It was during this time of death and suffering that 
the spotlight shined upon America as the only rich country without universal healthcare. So how is United States 
healthcare different from the rest? Only 36% of Americans, consisting of mainly the edlerly and the poor, require 
healthcare coverage through Medicaid or Medicare programs. Even after acts put into place took into effect, about 9% 
of the United States population goes without healthcare insurance at all. Most often 1 out of 4 people who are uninsured 
find themselves in high debt along with hospitals who find themselves bankrupt due to unpaid medical expenses received during 
emergencies. So what happened when the virus stuck? As confusion hit the nation so did the major need for supplies such as: 
materials for testing, ventilators for the infected, personal protective equipment, and more. The nationâ€™s lack of coordinated 
response to the virus ultimately wreaked havoc and the issue of addressing proper healthcare during such a time to those who 
couldn't afford it and even for those who could become a national issue. Not only would the nation deal with such an intense 
issue, but during the time of an election made it much worse. The virus and how it would be handled became a political issue 
and surely healthcare became a crucial part of the 2020 election as each running candidate spoke upon their opinions and ideas 
of solutions. Would our healthcare system be able to hold up for much longer?</p>
