<h3>Left-Sided Article: The New Republic - <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159513/trump-obamacare-executive-order-preexisting-conditions-aca-lies"><i>Trump Lies, and the Media Abides</i></a></h3>

<p>Has Donald Trump done as much as he has said? Not at all. Reporters over the past four years have 
filled articles on Trump’s plan with healthcare, but they regret to inform citizens that he has truly 
done nothing healthcare wise. An example in which the Trump administration has failed to reveal the 
truth, or for lack of better words, lie, is written about in a recent story posted to The Washington Post. 
It is within this story that it is stated the Trump administration signed off on an executive order that 
“aims to enshrine the [ACA’s] most popular feature” whereas the truth is, the executive did the exact opposite. 
So why are Trump and his administration determined to lie about the ACA? Simply because Trump and the Republicans 
following him do not believe insurers should be restricted from their large, large amounts of money. However, 
they do realize that they cannot defend making things worse as they stand terrible already so they insist on 
lying as their coverage. To support the ACA’s broad outlines can be seen as one of the most conservative views 
on healthcare and under Trump’s lying administration, the system stands “incredibly cruel, expensive, 
and stupid”.</p>

<h3>Right-Sided Article: The Federalist - <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/12/biden-informed-of-pfizers-vaccine-news-before-government-health-officials/"><i>Biden Informed Of Pfizer’s Vaccine News Before Government Health Officials</i></a></h3>

<p>How was it that the Biden campaign knew about the Coronavirus vaccine before the chief health care administrator? 
Was it convenient to him that this information was founded so near the election? Was this all coincidental? The Trump 
administration doesn’t think so. It was said from the chief health care administrator, Alex Azar, that he did not know 
about the vaccine's effectiveness until he heard about it, stating “I, as Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
learned about this from media reports on Monday morning”. The company producing the vaccine also lied about its 
participation in Operation Warp, a federal initiative driven by the Trump administration, and later had to correct 
itself stating that they did indeed take federal money to aid them in making a vaccine. The Biden/Harris administration 
has been against the vaccine the Trump administration would be pushing out because they believed it was rushed, so what 
is the sudden change? Now, shortly after the release of the vaccine the Biden/Harris administration has refrained 
from further criticism.</p>

<h3>Comparing Right and Left Sided Articles:</h3>

<p>Both articles, while discussing the issue of healthcare, take a very different approach to address the issue. In 
The Federalist's article the author, although still very biased, uses a more sophisticated tone to inform its reader 
about the current issue of lack of communication about the Coronavirus vaccine. Along with elaborate diction, The 
Federalist author backs the article up by introducing several remarks made by significant people. Thus, allowing the 
reader to feel confident about the provided information. The author sets the article up for the reader to develop 
their own opinion around the heavily influenced information. It is prominently shown, however, that this article is 
biased against the Biden administration as it points out its flaw in handling the most current issue - the 
Coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>The second article, written by Slate, takes a very passionate approach to the current issue of healthcare - specifically 
the issue of Obamacare. It is clear throughout the article that the author is in support of keeping Obamacare and has 
strong hatred toward the Trump administration. This author then goes on to ridicule the President and his administration 
for trying to rid Obamacare; the author states within the article several times that Trump and the republicans within the 
White House are nothing but liars. The author shows his knowledge of this topic but shows little factual evidence to back 
up his statements, leaving most of his work to be viewed as opinionated. Whether you agree or not, it would be incorrect 
to say that the author addresses both sides of the manner as well as attempts to provide evidence to back it. The article 
is driven by anger and passion, instead of being sophisticated and factual.</p>

<p>Like stated before, both articles, while discussing the issue of healthcare, take a very different approach to addressing 
the issue. It would be my conclusion to say that the Federalist article is the least bias (however still very bias) because of 
its strong use of quotation references.</p>

<h3>Comparing These Articles to Those In Part Three:</h3>

<p>In relation to the articles in part three, these two articles linked to above lack a strong evidence based background for 
the information they present. When referring to articles that sat in the green in yellow section, while bias was still there, 
it was hard to catch because factual information along with highly sophisticated diction was presented alongside it. In these 
articles in the orange section, there is little/minimal factual evidence and it can be easily noted how the author feels 
about the matter being written about. These two articles in the orange section, in comparison, do not match the level of 
reliability that the articles in part three might have. The articles start to turn more into an opinion rather than fact, 
which makes their source of information available to more susceptibility from their audience.</p>
