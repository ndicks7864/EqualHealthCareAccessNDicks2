<p>Three headlines that might appear for my topic of equal healthcare access could be as the following: 
for a center point of view - As more hospitals become overwhelmed with COVID-19 are those who are diable 
getting the same access?, for a left-sided point of view - A short but informative of how the Trump 
Administration has royally screwed our healthcare, and for the right-sided view - Don’t fall for Biden’s 
radical healthcare plan, it’s a hoax.</p>

<p>One issue that I have noticed throughout all sides of the issue of equal healthcare access is the 
inability of Democrats and Republicans to agree/compromise on some type of plane and therefore America 
has been left with one of the most complex versions of a healthcare system there is. As far Republicans, 
most favor a system in which everyone is responsible for receiving and providing their own healthcare access. 
They normally favor putting their own money into their healthcare access versus the idea of universal healthcare. 
Most Democrats however are in favor of universal healthcare in which taxes help fund and provide for those who 
are unable to gain access to decent healthcare. They don’t mind the raise in tax revenue if it means universal 
care for all.</p>

<p>Throughout this project, I have learned a plethora of information on the topic of equal healthcare access 
but three pieces of information that have stuck with me most are as follows. One, access to healthcare can 
impede all types of individuals in a variety of ways. Most people hear about stuff like the fight for trans 
healthcare access or pregnant gay healthcare assistance because of the high controversy that comes along with the 
topic, but people forget that others also might lack the access to healthcare - such as those who live in rural 
areas away from urbanization or those who are disabled. Two, the argument of healthcare will be one that is not 
easily resolved. Allowing everyone the right to equal access to healthcare is a tough journey that will take time 
and patience. It has made me understand that things may change but they may not. If we cannot collectively compromise 
and make decisions this journey will be a long one. Three, the media world that we live in can change, twist, and 
perceive things to be a certain way in which they are not. Looking at both sides, right and left, has opened my 
eyes to the realization that all information is interpreted in different ways and can therefore be reputed in 
different ways. To truly gain an understanding of where you stand on a topic you must conduct research or 
receive information from several reliable sources.</p>

<p>Before this project, I would have to admit that I was very one-sided and although my views and opinions do 
not waver from what I stood for before, I feel as if I am more informed about the topic of healthcare access. 
I have grown to listen to the factual evidence behind the views of others who differ from my own and take into 
consideration that those things for which they may stand behind may affect them personally. Regardless of what 
side you stand on, I have learned that education on the topic of equal healthcare access, along with other 
topics, is vital when it comes to having productive conversations and defending your opinion among others. 
After this project, I do feel that I can have a more educated and professional conversation with someone on 
the topic of healthcare because I believe I am now more informed than I ever have been.</p>

<p>Two things I have taken away from media bias is one, that you cannot trust every source you receive 
information from. Two, whether or not it is noticeable, there will always be bias in the information 
that we receive whether or not it's from the most reliable source there is or the least reliable source. 
Bias in humans is inevitable, therefore, when researching whatever topic a person must always keep in mind 
that in written articles, papers, or any form of journalism there is always a perspective that the author 
wants you to have. Another key thing I’ve learned about media bias is that since it is so inevitable, being 
able to receive information from several sources is crucial to understanding what information is true and 
what information is not.</p>
