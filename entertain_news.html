<h3>Left-Sided Article: Occupy Democrats - <a href="https://occupydemocrats.com/2020/10/21/trump-tries-to-get-back-at-60-minutes-accidentally-exposes-that-his-healthcare-book-is-blank/"><i>Trump tries to get back at 60 Minutes, accidentally exposes that his “healthcare book” is blank</i></a></h3>

<p>Donald J. Trump has shown America what it means to “fake it until you make it” as his career has been 
built on his false appearances, outrageous fraud, and shameless lies. His last performance appeared to 
backfire for him on the show 60 minutes as Donald Trump began to accuse reporter Lesley Stahl of producing 
fake and biased questions. One of the concerns addressed by Lesley Stahl during the interview, the topic of 
healthcare. Seeing how Trump has done nothing for American healthcare, besides trying to dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act, he alongside his team tried to present to Lesley an empty book “full” of healthcare plans under the 
Trump administration. This plan however backfired on him when a release of a zoomed in photo of the book proved 
it to be blank. The interview ended short however because 45 minutes into the interview Donaled Trump walked out 
and later that night went to twitter and threatened to release the footage before its airtime to show “everyone...a 
glimpse of [a] FAKE and BIASED interview…”. When the truth is all that was “FAKE” was Donald Trump's plan for healthcare.</p>

<h3>Right-Sided Article: Fox News - <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/justin-haskins-bidens-health-care-plan-heres-how-its-just-as-radical-and-dangerous-as-bernies"><i>Justin Haskins: Biden's health care plan – here's how it's just as radical and dangerous as Bernie's</i></a></h3>

<p>Since the Democratic primaries, the major debate comes to the healthcare system. Far left sided democrats 
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed a disastrous plan of Medicare-for-all” that would grant free 
access of healthcare to everyone at the cost of major tax increases. But now that Joe Biden is the only candidate 
left in the Democratic race, let's have a deeper look into his radical healthcare plan. Joe Biden's plan for healthcare 
can be summarized by the four main fundamental elements: creating a public health insurance similar to Medicare, 
dramatically increase subsidies for individuals and families, roll back some deregulatory efforts efforts made by 
Trump, and use the new public option as a replacement for Medicaid in states who refused Medicaid programs. As a 
whole, this plan would cause catastrophic impact on the U.S. healthcare system as tens of millions of people would 
be put into a government managed system that will rob healthcare workers of their hard earned money, increase 
deductibles to an unreasonable amount, and transform the U.S into a single-payer healthcare system model.</p>

<h3>Comparing Right and Left Sided Articles</h3>

<p>Both articles, while discussing the issue of healthcare, take a very different approach to address the issue. In 
The Federalist's article the author, although still very biased, uses a more sophisticated tone to inform its reader 
about the current issue of lack of communication about the Coronavirus vaccine. Along with elaborate diction, The 
Federalist author backs the article up by introducing several remarks made by significant people. Thus, allowing the 
reader to feel confident about the provided information. The author sets the article up for the reader to develop 
their own opinion around the heavily influenced information. It is prominently shown, however, that this article is 
biased against the Biden administration as it points out its flaw in handling the most current issue - the 
Coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>The second article, written by Slate, takes a very passionate approach to the current issue of healthcare - specifically 
the issue of Obamacare. It is clear throughout the article that the author is in support of keeping Obamacare and has 
strong hatred toward the Trump administration. This author then goes on to ridicule the President and his administration 
for trying to rid Obamacare; the author states within the article several times that Trump and the republicans within the 
White House are nothing but liars. The author shows his knowledge of this topic but shows little factual evidence to back 
up his statements, leaving most of his work to be viewed as opinionated. Whether you agree or not, it would be incorrect 
to say that the author addresses both sides of the manner as well as attempts to provide evidence to back it. The article 
is driven by anger and passion, instead of being sophisticated and factual.</p>

<p>Like stated before, both articles, while discussing the issue of healthcare, take a very different approach to addressing 
the issue. It would be my conclusion to say that the Federalist article is the least bias (however still very bias) because of 
its strong use of quotation references.</p>
