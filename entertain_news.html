<h3>Comparing Right and Left Sided Articles</h3>

<p>Both articles, while discussing the issue of healthcare, take a very different approach to address the issue. In 
The Federalist's article the author, although still very biased, uses a more sophisticated tone to inform its reader 
about the current issue of lack of communication about the Coronavirus vaccine. Along with elaborate diction, The 
Federalist author backs the article up by introducing several remarks made by significant people. Thus, allowing the 
reader to feel confident about the provided information. The author sets the article up for the reader to develop 
their own opinion around the heavily influenced information. It is prominently shown, however, that this article is 
biased against the Biden administration as it points out its flaw in handling the most current issue - the 
Coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>The second article, written by Slate, takes a very passionate approach to the current issue of healthcare - specifically 
the issue of Obamacare. It is clear throughout the article that the author is in support of keeping Obamacare and has 
strong hatred toward the Trump administration. This author then goes on to ridicule the President and his administration 
for trying to rid Obamacare; the author states within the article several times that Trump and the republicans within the 
White House are nothing but liars. The author shows his knowledge of this topic but shows little factual evidence to back 
up his statements, leaving most of his work to be viewed as opinionated. Whether you agree or not, it would be incorrect 
to say that the author addresses both sides of the manner as well as attempts to provide evidence to back it. The article 
is driven by anger and passion, instead of being sophisticated and factual.</p>

<p>Like stated before, both articles, while discussing the issue of healthcare, take a very different approach to addressing 
the issue. It would be my conclusion to say that the Federalist article is the least bias (however still very bias) because of 
its strong use of quotation references.</p>
