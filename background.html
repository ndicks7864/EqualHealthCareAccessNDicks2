<h3>History on Heathcare Access</h3>
<p>What is healthcare in america? To answer that question we need to start with the simple 
definition of what healthcare is. Healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of onesâ€™ 
health through prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure disease, injury, illness, 
or other physical and mental impairments in someone. In America, the licensed professionals are 
the ones providing services but whether or not you have access to these healthcare services and 
licensed professionals is based solely on your healthcare insurance. Healthcare insurance can be 
described as insurance (money paid towards) that covers part of the whole of one's medical expenses 
when injured. There are several forms of healthcare insurance provided by several different companies 
and citizens of the United states have the right to choose which company they want to insure them and 
also the right to choose if they would like healthcare insurance at all. But where did the process of 
healthcare insurance begin?</p>
