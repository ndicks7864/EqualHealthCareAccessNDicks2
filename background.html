<h3>History on Heathcare Access</h3>
<p>What is healthcare in america? To answer that question we need to start with the simple 
definition of what healthcare is. Healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of ones’ 
health through prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure disease, injury, illness, 
or other physical and mental impairments in someone. In America, the licensed professionals are 
the ones providing services but whether or not you have access to these healthcare services and 
licensed professionals is based solely on your healthcare insurance. Healthcare insurance can be 
described as insurance (money paid towards) that covers part of the whole of one's medical expenses 
when injured. There are several forms of healthcare insurance provided by several different companies 
and citizens of the United states have the right to choose which company they want to insure them and 
also the right to choose if they would like healthcare insurance at all. But where did the process of 
healthcare insurance begin?</p>

<p>Offering healthcare insurance first started in 1850 when the Franklin Health Assurance Company of 
Massachusetts started offering workers of railroad and steamboat companies healthcare insurance for their 
injuries on the job. It wouldn’t be long after that many companies followed in Franklin Healths’ footsteps, 
but however, they did not flourish as most of these companies only covered for workers who couldn't work, not 
their medical bills. After the Civil War ended the world was in desperate need for healthcare and as a result 
the United States Army established the Hospital Corps in 1886. The Hospital Corps would then begin its journey 
to collect a significant amount of data and John Shaw Billings, a senior surgeon during the war, sought to build 
a library in which this valuable information could be held. The Library of Surgeon General’s Office was created 
and would serve as a template for our modern medical information systems. In 1849, the American Medical Association 
(AMA) was created but wasn't however “popular” until around 1900. At this point in time, healthcare insurance was 
basically non-existent. The policy was what they called a “fee-for-service” which meant you must pay at the time 
you receive care.</p>

<p>The tide would turn when President Theodore Roosevelt was elected in 1901. He was an adamant healthcare supporter 
as he once said, “No country could be strong whose people were sick and poor”. Unions for proper health care insurance 
grew strong as many continued to work stenous and harmful jobs. The American Association of Labor Legislation (AALL), a 
once small union group, proposed a bill that stated qualified workers could receive sick pay, maternity leave, and death 
benefits of $50. Supported by the AMA intiallity, they soon backed out as others began to express objections. Doctors 
wondered how they would be compensated, healthcare union leaders feared compulsory health insurance would weaken their 
value, and private insurance industries believed it would undermine their businesses. The AALL Bill didn't gain enough 
support and therefore was dropped.</p>

<p>After WWI, the cost of healthcare became more pressing as hospitals and physicians were charging more than the average 
citizen could afford. As a result, a unique program was created in 1923 by Baylor Hospitals in Dalas to provide teachers 
with healthcare for a pre-paid monthly fee. This small program would grow into the Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Years later 
President Franklin D Roosevelt set into place the Social Security Act of 1935 - the first real system of its kind to provide 
public support for the retired and edlerly. Moving forward to WWII the focus of war was at the forehand, healthcare matters 
were put on hold but not for long. As the government stricken the idea of limiting wages with the Stabilization Act of 1942, 
employers looked for other ways to recruit new employees. They began offering employer-sponsored health insurance - which is 
still used today. This however did not work for everyone in the nation such as: retirees, unemployed, and those whose employers 
didn’t offer healthcare insurance were still stuck in a hole. The Wagner-Murray Bill was introduced in 1943 as a way to provide 
universal healthcare through payroll tax. This bill had high opposition as many, especially the elite, were not fond of paying 
for others health benefits - it was eventually dropped.</p>

<p>Time passed and medical advancement soared but with advancement came higher pricing; during the decade of the 1950s the price 
of hospital care doubled. The debate of healthcare insurance was only heating up as more of the helpless sought out for help. 
The United States citizens who couldn't afford sufficient healthcare insurance were suffering so in the year of 1965 Lydon B 
Johnson passed the Social Security Act of 1965 (an expansion of the Social Security Act of 1935); it would be this bill that 
laid the groundwork for what we now know as Medicare/Medicaid. For decades healthcare insurance and how it was provided was a 
huge crisis as many presidents sought to resolve the issue in their own ways.</p>

<p>Skipping to 1993 when President Clinton proposed the Health Security Act, an act which was a mix of universal coverage while 
still respecting private insurance systems. Individuals would have the choice to purchase insurance through state based cooperatives, 
companies couldn't deny anyone based on pre-existing conditions, and employers would be required to offer health insurance to full-time 
employees. Again opposition rose because of: increasing national deficit, opposition from big business, foreign affairs, and the 
complexity of the bill itself. The bill would die but during his time as President Clinton signed off many other important bills 
such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) - which established privacy standards for individuals and 
allowed record upon one's' request, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the expansion of Medicaid/Medicare. 
Medicaid/Medicare would also expand in 2003 when President Geroge W Bush passed the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and 
Modernization Act which covered the expenses of prescription drugs.</p>

<p>When Barack Obama was elected he waited no time to work on healthcare reform and on March 23, 2010 President Obama signed the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or Affordable Care Act (ACA) or ObamaCare. ACA faced heavy opposition from 
individual mandate and employer mandate and the plan was seen by some as a grand socialist plan designed to fail. Many currently 
believe it is giving the government too much power to themselves and private businesses. Not only that but Obamacare and Medicaid 
are responsible for the major increases in entitlement spending. Despite its opposition before the ACA, an estimated one in seven 
Americans were denied healthcare insurance due to their pre-existing healthcare issues but ACA opened doors to those who were/are 
denied. The debate on Obamacare can be a paper in itself but the fact is, this law represented the most significant overhaul and 
expansion of healthcare coverage since the passing of Medicare/Medicaid in 1965.</p>

<p>Today we continue the debate on what to do about healthcare insurance. Many for the national spread of healthcare insurance bills 
are those who can’t afford proper healthcare/benefit from acts in place like Medicaid and Obamacare, along with those who believe 
in inclusive access to healthcare even at their own expense. Those against national healthcare insurance such as big business and 
private companies (along with individuals) see to it that healthcare should be their own selected freedom not controlled by the 
government, that these spending in healthcare can be used elsewhere ,and that they should not have the responsibility to cover 
those who can't afford proper healthcare insurance. Private companies benefiting from private healthcare insurance also believe 
such a spread of national healthcare insurance would pull from their business in which they make money off of. Overall the debate 
of healthcare may never end as the nation oscillates between for and against national coverage. Whether bills change or acts pass, 
the real issue of it all is that Americans can never account for the unexpected; conditions arise, illnesses take lives, bones break, 
well the list actually never ends and as a nation we are looking for proper medical care when we need it - whether we get it one way 
or another.</p>
