<h2> <img class="left" src="img/snake_icon.png" alt="knife"> Why did I choose the topic of equal healthcare access? </h2>


<p>Although I have no personal struggle in accessing sufficient healthcare, the topic of equal 
healthcare access for all interests me because I believe the sufficiency of healthcare access an 
individual has should not be determined on that individualsâ€™ financial status. Besides my stance 
behind the right to equal healthcare access, I also choose this topic because the effects of unequal 
access to healthcare across the nation causes problems such as financial burdens (debt), which can 
result in any of the following: poor hygiene, miscare of self, higher mortality and disability rates, 
and much more. By equalizing healthcare across the nations these problems could be if not completely but fairly, 
I believe, resolved. This is why I decided to choose this topic.</p>
